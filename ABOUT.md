# ABOUT Information

## Description of the project
-This project can be implemented in room controller unit contains a light switcher -switches the light on/off- and display unit - displays temperature value -, also can be used  to end this data to mobile application and control it from
this project can be enhanced by

1.adding a signal to be sent to air conditioner and vary the temp according to reading .

2.put arduino to sleep till interrupt happens and it will wake up atuomaticlly to conserve the power by using arduino sleep functions/library

3-send data to mobile application by using internert or serial communication with mater unit that have internet connection
and view /edit data from it


## Topics learnt
#### What i Have learnt:
 i have worked in arduino before  in making this projects
 1. RC car controlled by mobile app 
 2. RC car can 
    - follow  actual lines on ground
    - save followed lines
    - follow lines  is sent from mobile by using custom drawing mobile app
    - send saved tracks and draw it on the app
 3. RC car with 10 sensors and send/actuate the sensors ,actuator to /from the app

 also i have worked on tiva c kit 'arm microproccesser  cortex m4'
 i have covered this topics:
 1. software interrupts
 2. hardware iterrupts
 3. timer interrupts
 4.timers
 5. uart serial communication protocol
 6. GPIO 
 
 i have made some projects to test the functionly of tiva c and apply on this topic 
 for example 
   -a  live digital meter using ultrasonic sensor , 7 segments and timer
 
 so this helps me in learning interrupts in arduino and how i use timers 
 
 my experience in c/c++ 
* ihave been  practicing this language  for 3 years making 3 software  big projects  and alot of mini projects/alot of arduino +tiva c projects
 - software projects:
  -  calcuation project like Matlab but open source dealing with matrices , it can create ,concatinate ,mathimatical operation,postfix ,prefix calcuations on matrices form cmd and file source and result it pushed to file
  [More details][https://github.com/Abuelseaoud/AsuMathlabG22]
  
  -  data structure project to create a whole database to the faculty, the output is student ,doctors ,hall reservation, best exam schedules  datasheets
